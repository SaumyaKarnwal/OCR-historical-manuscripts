# OCR-historical-manuscripts
OCR-historical-manuscripts is a project focused on the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of historical manuscripts. It involves the development of algorithms and tools to extract text from scanned images of centuries-old documents, particularly in Spanish from the seventeenth century. The project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of OCR specifically tailored for historical texts, considering the challenges posed by language evolution, spelling variations, and the quality of the source documents.
